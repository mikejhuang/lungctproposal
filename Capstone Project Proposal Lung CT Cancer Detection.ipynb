For example, air has very high transmittance and has a radiodensity of -1000HU. Soft tissue has a radio density of 100-300HU. Bone has a radiodensity between 700-3000HU. Most of the space within the lung consists of air. Nodules consist of spherical tissues within the lung with a radiodensity between 100-300HU. \n",
